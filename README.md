# AP4-TP
this is a small project to read and display data in TESS Target Pixel file.
A target pixel file contains the raw and calibrated fluxes for the pixels downloaded at a cadence shorter than the full frame images. 
Nominally, these are at a two-minute cadence. It also contains information about the aperture, including which pixels were used to calculate the total flux, which pixels were used to estimate the background flux, and which pixels were used to calculate the flux weighted or pixel response function centroids.
